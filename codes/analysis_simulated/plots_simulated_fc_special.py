1.
2. Overplot BTE vs MTE
  * Load all FC files, parse names into pandas
  * Group together files where only METHOD is diff
  * Plot 1: FP-freq by method
  * Plot 2: FN-freq by method
3. Overplot DS, Lpfsub, noise
  * Load all FC files, parse names into pandas
  * Group together files where only MODELNAME is diff
  * Plot 1: FP-freq by method
  * Plot 2: FN-freq by method
4. Overplot DS, RealData for nData, Lag, DS - one mouse. See if already done in mtp15 - I long forgot
  * Load analysis-paired FC files - (DS vs RealData)
  * Plot 1: FP-DS, NConn-Real (BTE)
  * Plot 2: FP-DS, NConn-Real (MTE)
